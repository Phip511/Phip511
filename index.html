    <h3> -Current projects</h3>

        <pre>
    Right now, I am working on a calculator/counter for calculating pokemon evs,
    as well as smaller-scale projects in order to learn new computer languages / become
    more familiar with them.

    <h3> -Current learning goals</h3>
    <p1>
        <pre>   I am currently attending the University of Oregon, where I am studying lambda calculus and data structures currently.
    Next quarter I will be taking a higher level C/C++ class that will help me hone my skills.
    Outside of school I am learning html and javascript on my own 
    (I made this page myself with no assisted tools, so apologies for the jankiness of it)
